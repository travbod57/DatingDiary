On pages which are adds or edits and the animation slides in from the right if I put "AnimationContext = LayoutRoot;" in the constructor and there is a Combobox on the page the value of the selectedItem 
won't get updated in the property or in the UI until I go to change it a second time. It always appears one step behind.

WP7Contrib is an assembly whcih provides a very similar animated base class to the one in position currently (Clarity).
